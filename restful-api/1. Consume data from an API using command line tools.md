# Task 1: Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

## Overview
This document provides a brief explanation of the sequence diagrams created for the HBNB application.  
Each diagram illustrates how an API request flows through the system layers:
**User → API → Service (Business Logic) → Database**.

---

## 1. User Registration
**API Call:** `POST /users`

This sequence diagram represents the process of creating a new user account.
- The user sends a registration request to the API.
- The API validates the user data and forwards it to the service layer.
- The service saves the user in the database.
- A success response (`201 Created`) is returned to the user.

---

## 2. Place Creation
**API Call:** `POST /places.`

This diagram shows how a new place listing is created.
- The user submits place data through the API.
- The API validates the request and passes it to the service layer.
- The service stores the place in the database.
- A successful creation response is sent back to the user.

## 3. Review Submission
**API Call:** `POST /reviews.`

This diagram illustrates the review creation flow.
- The user submits a review for a specific place.
- The API validates the review data.
- The service saves the review in the database.
- The system returns a confirmation response to the user.

## 4. Fetching a List of Places
**API Call:** `GET /places.`

This sequence diagram represents retrieving a list of places.
- The user sends a request to fetch places.
- The API forwards the request to the service layer.
- The service queries the database for place data.
- The list of places is returned to the user as a response.

## Conclusion
These sequence diagrams demonstrate how API requests are processed across different layers of the application, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities and efficient data flow.
