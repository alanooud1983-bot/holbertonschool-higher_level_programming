# 1. Consume data from an API using command line tools (curl)

## Background
`curl` is a command-line tool used to transfer data to/from a server using supported protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS.
It is commonly used to test APIs, debug requests, inspect responses, and quickly interact with RESTful endpoints.

## Objective
By the end of this task, you should be able to:
1. Verify that `curl` is installed and available in your terminal.
2. Send basic API requests using `curl` (GET/POST) and inspect the output.
3. Fetch response headers and interpret common status codes.

## Resources
- curl documentation
- Using curl to interact with HTTP APIs
- JSONPlaceholder (Public API for testing)

## Instructions

### 1) Verify curl installation
Run the following command to confirm `curl` is available:
```bash
curl --version
